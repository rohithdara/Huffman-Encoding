# Huffman-Encoding
This program compresses data using the Huffman encoding algorithm. It outputs both a file composed of compressed bits as well as a file with the binary expanded for readability. The text files were made to unit test my code, and can be used as examples of properly processed text files.

Within the huffman.py file, add this line of code:

huffman_encode(in_file_name.txt,out_file_name.txt)

Then, to run this program:

```
python3 huffman.py
```

If you don't have version 3 of python, you can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
